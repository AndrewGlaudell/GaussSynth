## Package Info

Package Version: 1.0


Written for Mathematica Version: 12.0

Keywords: Quantum Compiling, Quantum Circuit Synthesis, Clifford Group, Controlled Phase Gate, Normal Forms, Exact Synthesis, Approximate Synthesis


## Description:
The GaussSynth.m package is a package for quantum compiling on two qubits using the Clifford group and the Controlled-Phase gate CS. The circuits which are exactly expressible over this gate set constitute every 4x4 unitary matrix which can be written as a matrix of Gaussian integers divided by some non-negative integer power of 2^(1/2) -- hence the package name. In this package, we supply a number of functions for performing quantum circuit synthesis on this gate set, both in the exact and approximate case. The algorithms in this package are based off of the work of Andrew Glaudell, Julien Ross, Matthew Amy, and Jake Taylor, and for details related to how these algorithms were developed, I suggest reading the articles [1-3] in the sources section below.


## Warnings:
I have used a fair amount of input checking so that functions only accept inputs of the appropriate form. This comes at the cost of some speed -- that being said, these checks cause constant overhead, and so their performance impact is worth it to prevent some erroneous calculation from being carried out. If you don't care about this input checking, one could relatively easily define their own functions from my own internal ones to slightly speed up their performance.


## Limitations:
This package is only intended for usage on two-qubit circuits. To perform circuit synthesis on larger circuits, I suggest loading this package and using these functions as subroutines.


## Algorithm Information:
Rather than describe these algorithms in detail here, I differ to the sources [1-3] listed above or the function descriptions.


## Requirements:
None


## Installation Instructions:
Install the file GaussSynth.m wherever you would like. To make things simplest, save to somewhere in your current Mathematica $Path or your working directory.


## Loading Instructions:
Make sure that GaussSynth.m is saved to somewhere on your current Mathematica $Path or in your current working directory. If it is not, either add that location to the $Path (see https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/$Path.html) or set your current directory to the one which includes GaussSynth.m with SetDirectory (see https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SetDirectory.html).

Once this is done, use the following command to load the package:

Needs["GaussSynth`"];


## Usage Instructions:

We export a number of pre-defined variables and functions for the user. These can be checked directly in Mathematica after loading the package; for example, the command:

NormIt::usage

would list the use cases of the pre-defined NormIt function, as well as any options. Here is a list of the exported variables and functions:
